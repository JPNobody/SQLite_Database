# Overview

My software creates a database for monsters for table top RPGs. It also creates a interface by which you can view, add to, update, and delete from the monsters in the database.

The purpose of this project was to deepen my understanding about database construction, and to understand how to create a user interface to input data into the database. This project is also useful for me to manage the monsters in the table top RPG games that I play.
